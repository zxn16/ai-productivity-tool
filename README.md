# 🧠 AI Productivity Tool – Smart Calendar & Task Manager

This project is part of a larger AI productivity system designed to help busy individuals automate their day and week.

At its core, this tool runs on a **dedicated screen** (e.g. wall-mounted Raspberry Pi or desktop app) that displays:
- A **daily calendar view**
- A **live to-do list**
- **Weekly goal tracking**
- **AI-generated time suggestions** for unplanned tasks

Tasks and goals are added instantly from a mobile interface, and the system uses AI logic to automatically:
- Suggest the best time slots
- Avoid conflicts
- Prioritize tasks around fixed events and recurring goals

## 🚀 Key Features (WIP)

- ✅ Fullscreen desktop app built with **Electron + React + Tailwind CSS**
- 🔄 **Realtime updates** using Supabase (planned)
- 📱 Mobile to-do input (PWA or React Native — in progress)
- 🎯 Smart **weekly goal scheduling** ("gym 3x", "read 2h", etc.)
- 🤖 **AI scheduling engine** to structure your calendar automatically
